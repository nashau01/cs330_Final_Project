Final Project

Your final project must be written using the Flask application framework.
It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the
following criteria in terms of the use of web2py.

To earn an A on the project you will need to [complete the following].

You must have at least three controllers (Think python functions with @app.route decorators)
You must have at least three views (Think templates)
You must use the SqlAlchemy plugin and create a database with 3-4 tables. These tables should incorporate a one to many relationship in some way, or they may have a many to many relationship.
You should deploy your project on Heroku, appengine, or some other free hosting site so that it is freely accessible and not on the Luther network.
You should incorporate the WTForms module into your application for processing form data.
You should provide a small AJAX API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages. Or you may incorporate some other more advanced Flask Plugin that you OK with me.
Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.
You may work in teams of 2 on this project, unless you are doing the blogging application.
